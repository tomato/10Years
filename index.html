        <h3>Who am I?</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>I've spent 12 Years working on the development team at Biomni
          <li>Our product is an "IT Services Interface"
          <li>I've been blogging about my experiences for 5 years at "Diary of a Scrummaster"
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Where did we start?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>"Just go and build it"
          <li> Worked alone 
          <li> Each dev assigned features, took weeks to months 
          <li> Worked from documents
          <li> Shallow code reviews
          <li> Long Test Periods, QA dept at opposite end of office
          <li> Boredom, Frustration, Shrinking team
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>2003-2007</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Continuous Integration
          <li> Unit testing - well we tried
          <li> Concious of importance of quality
          <li> Starting to collaborate, but mostly alone
     </section>
     <section>
       <h2> 2008-2011: Scrum</h2>
       <ul>
         <li> Autonomy! Self actualisation
         <li> limiting WIP with a 3 week sprint
         <li> Collaboration within the team - Daily standup, increasing amounts of pairing
         <li> Reflection - Regular retrospectives and standups
         <li> Predictable - Delivered on time, 
         <li> Problems: testing overrun, buglog, limited creativity?
     </section>
    <section>
      <h2>2011- Using Kanban to improve</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Abandoned fixed length sprint
          <li> Set Coding WIP at 10 where it has roughly stayed - frequently hit
          <li> Measured lead time - particularly around defects 
          <li> Focus on keeping work flowing
          <li> Dropped estimation unless asked for
          <li> QA &amp; Devs work more closely
          <li> Allowed changes to backlog at any time
          <li> More collaboration outside team

        <h2>Many developers just want to code</h2>
        <h3>But...</h3>

        <h3>Here's what worked for us</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Pair Programming is collaboration whilst coding
            <li>Keep standups and reflection brief and focused
            <li>When frustration kicks in suggest an experiment
            <li>Give people space, listen to their needs, commuinicate non-violently
