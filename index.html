        <h3>Who Am I?</h3>

        <h2>Where Did We Start?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>"Just go and build it"
          <li> Worked alone 
          <li> Each dev assigned features, took weeks to months 
          <li> Worked from documents
          <li> Shallow code reviews
          <li> Long Test Periods, QA dept at opposite end of office
        </ul>
        <h3> Lateness, Boredom, Frustration, Shrinking team</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>2003-2007: The Beginning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Team Lead leaves - less Command and Control
          <li> Starting to collaborate, but coding alone
          <li> More conscious of importance of quality
          <li> Continuous Integration
          <li> Unit testing - well we tried
        </ul>
        <h3> Lateness, Learning, Frustration, Shrinking team</h3>
     </section>
     <section>
       <h2> 2008-2011: Scrum</h2>
       <ul>
         <li> Autonomy! Self actualisation
         <li> limiting WIP with a 3 week sprint
         <li> Collaboration within the team - Daily standup, increasing amounts of pairing
         <li> Reflection - Regular retrospectives and standups
         <li> Predictable - Delivered on time 
         <li> Problems: testing overrun, buglog, limited creativity?
       </ul>
        <h3> Deliver within 4 weeks, Learning, Self Actualisation, What Next?</h3>
     </section>
    <section>
      <h2>2011- Using Kanban to Improve</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Abandoned fixed length sprint
          <li> Set Coding WIP at 10 where it has roughly stayed - frequently hit
          <li> Measured lead time - particularly around defects 
          <li> Focus on keeping work flowing
          <li> Dropped estimation unless asked for
          <li> QA &amp; Devs work more closely
          <li> Allowed changes to backlog at any time
          <li> More collaboration outside team
       </ul>
        <h3> Deliver within 2 weeks, Learning, Creativity, Wider Collaboration, less Us and Them</h3>
